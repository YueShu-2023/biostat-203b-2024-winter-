In this exercise, we use tidyverse (ggplot2, dplyr, etc) to explore the [MIMIC-IV](https://mimic.mit.edu/docs/iv/) data introduced in [homework 1](https://ucla-biostat-203b.github.io/2024winter/hw/hw1/hw1.html) and to build a cohort of ICU stays.

## Q1. Visualizing patient trajectory

Visualizing a patient's encounters in a health care system is a common task in clinical data analysis. In this question, we will visualize a patient's ADT (admission-discharge-transfer) history and ICU vitals in the MIMIC-IV data.

### Q1.1 ADT history

A patient's ADT history records the time of admission, discharge, and transfer in the hospital. This figure shows the ADT history of the patient with `subject_id` 10001217 in the MIMIC-IV data. The x-axis is the calendar time, and the y-axis is the type of event (ADT, lab, procedure). The color of the line segment represents the care unit. The size of the line segment represents whether the care unit is an ICU/CCU. The crosses represent lab events, and the shape of the dots represents the type of procedure. The title of the figure shows the patient's demographic information and the subtitle shows top 3 diagnoses.

![](10001217_adt.png)
Do a similar visualization for the patient with `subject_id` 10013310 using ggplot.

Hint: We need to pull information from data files `patients.csv.gz`, `admissions.csv.gz`, `transfers.csv.gz`, `labevents.csv.gz`, `procedures_icd.csv.gz`, `diagnoses_icd.csv.gz`, `d_icd_procedures.csv.gz`, and `d_icd_diagnoses.csv.gz`. For the big file `labevents.csv.gz`, use the Parquet format you generated in Homework 2. For reproducibility, make the Parquet folder `labevents_pq` available at the current working directory `hw3`, for example, by a symbolic link. Make your code reproducible.

**Answer:**

```{r}

# read in the data
patients <- read_csv("~/mimic/hosp/patients.csv.gz")%>%
  filter(subject_id == 10013310)

admissions <- read_csv("~/mimic/hosp/admissions.csv.gz")%>%
  filter(subject_id == 10013310)%>%
  mutate(admittime = as.POSIXct(admittime),dischtime = as.POSIXct(dischtime))

transfers <- read_csv("~/mimic/hosp/transfers.csv.gz")%>%
  filter(subject_id == 10013310)%>%
  mutate(intime = as.POSIXct(intime),outtime = as.POSIXct(outtime))

labevents <- read_parquet("~/labevents.parquet/part-0.parquet")%>%
  filter(subject_id == 10013310)%>%
  mutate(charttime = as.POSIXct(charttime))

            select(icd_code,long_title),by=("icd_code"))%>%
  collect()


diagnoses_icd <- read_csv("~/mimic/hosp/diagnoses_icd.csv.gz")%>%
  left_join(read_csv("~/mimic/hosp/d_icd_diagnoses.csv.gz"))%>%
  filter(subject_id==10013310)%>%
  collect()

transfers <- transfers %>%
  filter(eventtype != "discharge")

top_diagnoses <- diagnoses_icd %>%
  arrange(seq_num) %>%
  distinct(long_title, .keep_all = TRUE) %>%
  slice_head(n = 3) %>%
  pull(long_title) %>%
  paste(collapse = "\n")

patient_title <- paste("Patient 10013310",  
                       ", ", patients$gender, 
                       ", ", patients$anchor_age, 
                       " years old, ", tolower(admissions$race), sep = "")

``` 


```{r}
ggplot() +
  geom_segment(data =  transfers, aes(x = intime, xend = outtime,
                                   y = "ADT", yend = "ADT",
                                   color = careunit,
               linewidth= str_detect(careunit, "ICU|CCU"))) +
  geom_point(data = procedures_icd, aes(x = chartdate, y = "Procedure", shape=long_title)) +
  geom_point(data = labevents, aes(x = charttime, y = "Lab"),
              shape = 3) +
  theme_bw(base_size = 7) +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom", legend.box = "vertical") +
  scale_y_discrete(limits = c("Procedure", "Lab", "ADT")) +
  labs(title = patient_title, subtitle = top_diagnoses,
       x = "Calendar swsTime", y = "Event Type", color = "Care Unit") 
```


### Q1.2 ICU stays

ICU stays are a subset of ADT history. This figure shows the vitals of the patient `10001217` during ICU stays. The x-axis is the calendar time, and the y-axis is the value of the vital. The color of the line represents the type of vital. The facet grid shows the abbreviation of the vital and the stay ID.

![](10001217_icu.png)

Do a similar visualization for the patient `10013310`.

**Answer:**

```{r}
library(data.table)

chartevents_tble1 <- arrow::open_dataset("~/chartevents.parquet", format = "parquet") %>%
  filter(subject_id ==10013310) %>%
  collect()

icustays_tble1 <- read_csv("~/mimic/icu/icustays.csv.gz")

icustays_tble1 <- icustays_tble1 %>%
  mutate(subject_id == 10013310)

chartevents_tble1 <- chartevents_tble1 %>%
  mutate(subject_id = 10013310)

# Join chartevents with icustays
chartevents_icustays <- chartevents_tble1 %>%
  inner_join(icustays_tble1, by = c("subject_id", "hadm_id", "stay_id"))


# Read item information from a CSV file
cht <- fread("~/mimic/icu/d_items.csv.gz", select = c("itemid", "abbreviation"))

# Join item information with chart events
chartevents_icustays <- merge(chartevents_icustays, cht, by = "itemid", all.x = TRUE)

# Filter vital signs
vital_signs <- c("HR", "NBPd", "NBPs", "RR", "Temperature F")
# Filter rows in chartevents_icustays based on 'abbreviation' column
chartevents_icustays <- chartevents_icustays[chartevents_icustays$abbreviation %in% vital_signs, ]

# Plot vital sign data
ggplot(data = chartevents_icustays , aes(x = charttime, y = as.numeric(value), color = abbreviation)) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_point(size = 0.5) +
  facet_grid(abbreviation ~ stay_id, scales = "free_x", space = "free_y") +
  labs(
    x = "",
    y = "",
    title = "ICU Stays - Vital Signs",
    color = "Vital Sign"
  ) +
  theme(
    legend.title = element_blank(),
    legend.position = "bottom",
    strip.text = element_text(size = 5)
  ) +
  scale_x_datetime(labels = scales::date_format("%b %d\n%H:%M:%S"))
  
```

## Q2. ICU stays

`icustays.csv.gz` (<https://mimic.mit.edu/docs/iv/modules/icu/icustays/>) contains data about Intensive Care Units (ICU) stays. The first 10 lines are
```{bash}
zcat < ~/mimic/icu/icustays.csv.gz | head
```

### Q2.1 Ingestion

Import `icustays.csv.gz` as a tibble `icustays_tble`. 

**Answer:**

```{r}
icustays_tble <- read_csv("~/mimic/icu/icustays.csv.gz")
class(icustays_tble)
```

### Q2.2 Summary and visualization

How many unique `subject_id`? Can a `subject_id` have multiple ICU stays? Summarize the number of ICU stays per `subject_id` by graphs. 

**Answer:**

```{r}
unique_subject_ids <- icustays_tble %>% 
  distinct(subject_id) %>% 
  nrow()

# Summarize the number of ICU stays per subject_id using graphs
icu_stay_summary <- icustays_tble %>% 
  group_by(subject_id) %>% 
  summarise(num_stays = n()) 

# Create a histogram of the number of ICU stays per subject_id
ggplot(icu_stay_summary, aes(x = num_stays)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1, fill = "skyblue", color = "black") +
  labs(x = "Number of ICU Stays", y = "Frequency", title = "ICU Stays per Subject ID")

```

## Q3. `admissions` data

Information of the patients admitted into hospital is available in `admissions.csv.gz`. See <https://mimic.mit.edu/docs/iv/modules/hosp/admissions/> for details of each field in this file. The first 10 lines are
```{bash}
zcat < ~/mimic/hosp/admissions.csv.gz | head
```

### Q3.1 Ingestion

Import `admissions.csv.gz` as a tibble `admissions_tble`.

**Answer:**

```{r}
admissions_tble <- read_csv("~/mimic/hosp/admissions.csv.gz")
class(admissions_tble)

```

### Q3.2 Summary and visualization

Summarize the following information by graphics and explain any patterns you see.

- number of admissions per patient  
- admission hour (anything unusual?)  
- admission minute (anything unusual?)  
- length of hospital stay (from admission to discharge) (anything unusual?)  

According to the [MIMIC-IV documentation](https://mimic.mit.edu/docs/iv/about/concepts/#date-shifting), 

> All dates in the database have been shifted to protect patient confidentiality. Dates will be internally consistent for the same patient, but randomly distributed in the future. Dates of birth which occur in the present time are not true dates of birth. Furthermore, dates of birth which occur before the year 1900 occur if the patient is older than 89. In these cases, the patient’s age at their first admission has been fixed to 300.

**Answer:**

```{r}
# Summarize the number of admissions per patient
num_admissions <- admissions_tble %>% 
  group_by(subject_id) %>% 
  summarise(num_admissions = n())

# Create a histogram of the number of admissions per patient
ggplot(num_admissions, aes(x = num_admissions)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1, fill = "skyblue", color = "black") +
  labs(x = "Number of Admissions", y = "Frequency", title = "Admissions per Patient")

# Create a histogram of the admission hour
ggplot(admissions_tble, aes(x = hour(admittime))) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1, fill = "skyblue", color = "black") +
  labs(x = "Admission Hour", y = "Frequency", title = "Admission Hour")

# Create a histogram of the admission minute
ggplot(admissions_tble, aes(x = minute(admittime))) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1, fill = "skyblue", color = "black") +
  labs(x = "Admission Minute", y = "Frequency", title = "Admission Minute")

# Create a histogram of the length of hospital stay
admissions_tble <- admissions_tble %>% 
  mutate(length_of_stay = difftime(dischtime, admittime, units = "days"))

ggplot(admissions_tble, aes(x = length_of_stay)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1, fill = "skyblue", color = "black") +
  labs(x = "Length of Hospital Stay (Days)", y = "Frequency", title = "Length of Hospital Stay")

```

Most people 1 have 1 admission, and the admission hour mainly in the night and in 0 o'clock, 7 o'clock. The admission minute is mainly in 0, 15, 30, 45 minute. The interval is fifteen minutes. And the length of hospital stay is mainly in 0-10 days.

## Q4. `patients` data

Patient information is available in `patients.csv.gz`. See <https://mimic.mit.edu/docs/iv/modules/hosp/patients/> for details of each field in this file. The first 10 lines are
```{bash}
zcat < ~/mimic/hosp/patients.csv.gz | head
```

### Q4.1 Ingestion

Import `patients.csv.gz` (<https://mimic.mit.edu/docs/iv/modules/hosp/patients/>) as a tibble `patients_tble`.

**Answer:**

```{r}
patients_tble <- read_csv("~/mimic/hosp/patients.csv.gz")
class(patients_tble)
```

### Q4.2 Summary and visualization

Summarize variables `gender` and `anchor_age` by graphics, and explain any patterns you see.

**Answer:**

```{r}
gender_summary <- patients_tble %>%
  count(gender) %>%
  mutate(percent = n / sum(n) * 100)

ggplot(gender_summary, aes(x = gender, y = percent, fill = gender)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  labs(title = "Gender Distribution of Patients",
       x = "Gender",
       y = "Percentage") +
  theme_minimal()

anchor_age_summary <- patients_tble %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = anchor_age)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 10, fill = "skyblue", color = "black") +
  labs(title = "Distribution of Anchor Ages",
       x = "Anchor Age",
       y = "Frequency") +
  theme_minimal()

print(anchor_age_summary)

```

Most patients are female and the anchor age is mainly under 75 years old. Most patients are very young under 25 years.

## Q5. Lab results

`labevents.csv.gz` (<https://mimic.mit.edu/docs/iv/modules/hosp/labevents/>) contains all laboratory measurements for patients. The first 10 lines are
```{bash}
zcat < ~/mimic/hosp/labevents.csv.gz | head
```

`d_labitems.csv.gz` (<https://mimic.mit.edu/docs/iv/modules/hosp/d_labitems/>) is the dictionary of lab measurements. 
```{bash}
zcat < ~/mimic/hosp/d_labitems.csv.gz | head
```

We are interested in the lab measurements of creatinine (50912), potassium (50971), sodium (50983), chloride (50902), bicarbonate (50882), hematocrit (51221), white blood cell count (51301), and glucose (50931). Retrieve a subset of `labevents.csv.gz` that only containing these items for the patients in `icustays_tble`. Further restrict to the last available measurement (by `storetime`) before the ICU stay. The final `labevents_tble` should have one row per ICU stay and columns for each lab measurement.

![](labevents_tble.png)


Hint: Use the Parquet format you generated in Homework 2. For reproducibility, make `labevents_pq` folder available at the current working directory `hw3`, for example, by a symbolic link.

**Answer:**

```{r}
library(tidyverse)

# Read d_labitems data
d_labitems <- read_csv("~/mimic/hosp/d_labitems.csv.gz", 
                        col_types = cols(
                          label = col_character(),
                          fluid = col_character(),
                          category = col_character(),
                          itemid = col_double())) %>%
  print(width = Inf)

icustays_tble <- icustays_tble %>%
  mutate(subject_id = as.character(subject_id))

labevents <- read_parquet("~/labevents.parquet/part-0.parquet")

# Read the lab events data and perform a series of transformations
labevents_tble <- labevents %>%
  select(subject_id, itemid, valuenum, storetime) %>%
  mutate(
    subject_id = as.character(subject_id),
    itemid = as.numeric(itemid)
  ) %>%
  filter(subject_id %in% icustays_tble$subject_id) %>%
  filter(itemid %in% c(50912, 50971, 50983, 50902, 
                       50882, 51221, 51301, 50931)) %>%
  collect() %>%
  left_join(icustays_tble, by = "subject_id") %>%
  left_join(d_labitems, by = "itemid") %>%
  select(subject_id, stay_id, label, valuenum, storetime, intime) %>%
  filter(storetime < intime) %>%
  group_by(subject_id, stay_id, label) %>%
  slice_max(order_by = storetime, n = 1) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  pivot_wider(
    names_from = label,
    values_from = valuenum,
    values_fn = list(valuenum = last)
  )

# Print the resulting labevents table
print(labevents_tble)

```

## Q6. Vitals from charted events

`chartevents.csv.gz` (<https://mimic.mit.edu/docs/iv/modules/icu/chartevents/>) contains all the charted data available for a patient. During their ICU stay, the primary repository of a patient’s information is their electronic chart. The `itemid` variable indicates a single measurement type in the database. The `value` variable is the value measured for `itemid`. The first 10 lines of `chartevents.csv.gz` are
```{bash}
zcat < ~/mimic/icu/chartevents.csv.gz | head
```

`d_items.csv.gz` (<https://mimic.mit.edu/docs/iv/modules/icu/d_items/>) is the dictionary for the `itemid` in `chartevents.csv.gz`. 
```{bash}
zcat < ~/mimic/icu/d_items.csv.gz | head
```

We are interested in the vitals for ICU patients: heart rate (220045), systolic non-invasive blood pressure (220179), diastolic non-invasive blood pressure (220180), body temperature in Fahrenheit (223761), and respiratory rate (220210). Retrieve a subset of `chartevents.csv.gz` only containing these items for the patients in `icustays_tble`. Further restrict to the first vital measurement within the ICU stay. The final `chartevents_tble` should have one row per ICU stay and columns for each vital measurement. 

![](chartevents_tble.png)

Hint: Use the Parquet format you generated in Homework 2. For reproducibility, make `chartevents_pq` folder available at the current working directory, for example, by a symbolic link.

**Amswer:**

```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)

# Read the d_items.csv.gz file
d_items <- read_csv("~/mimic/icu/d_items.csv.gz")

# Specify vital signs itemids
vitals <- c(220045, 220179, 220180, 223761, 220210)

# Load chartevents data from Parquet (more efficient for large datasets)
chartevents_tble <- arrow::open_dataset("~/chartevents.parquet", format = "parquet") %>%
  filter(itemid %in% vitals) %>%
  collect()

# Ensure subject_id is of the same type in both datasets
icustays_tble <- icustays_tble %>%
  mutate(subject_id = as.character(subject_id))

chartevents_tble <- chartevents_tble %>%
  mutate(subject_id = as.character(subject_id))

# Join chartevents with icustays
chartevents_icustays <- chartevents_tble %>%
  inner_join(icustays_tble, by = c("subject_id", "hadm_id", "stay_id")) %>%
  filter(charttime >= intime & charttime <= outtime)

# Select the first measurement within ICU stay
chartevents_first_meas <- chartevents_icustays %>%
  group_by(subject_id, stay_id, itemid) %>%
  summarise(value = first(value, order_by = charttime), .groups = "drop")

# Pivot to the required format
chartevents_final_tble <- chartevents_first_meas %>%
  pivot_wider(
    id_cols = c(subject_id, stay_id),
    names_from = itemid,
    values_from = value,
    names_prefix = "vital_"
  )%>%
  rename(
    heart_rate = vital_220045,
    systolic_blood_pressure = vital_220179,
    diastolic_blood_pressure = vital_220180,
    body_temperature_Fahrenheit = vital_223761,
    respiratory_rate = vital_220210
  )

print(chartevents_final_tble)

```


## Q7. Putting things together

Let us create a tibble `mimic_icu_cohort` for all ICU stays, where rows are all ICU stays of adults (age at `intime` >= 18) and columns contain at least following variables

- all variables in `icustays_tble`  
- all variables in `admissions_tble`  
- all variables in `patients_tble`
- the last lab measurements before the ICU stay in `labevents_tble` 
- the first vital measurements during the ICU stay in `chartevents_tble`

The final `mimic_icu_cohort` should have one row per ICU stay and columns for each variable.

![](mimic_icu_cohort.png)
```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(readr)

labevents_tble <- labevents_tble%>%
  as_tibble()%>%
  mutate(subject_id = as.character(subject_id))

# Read and convert admissions data into a tibble
admissions_tble <- read_csv("~/mimic/hosp/admissions.csv.gz") %>%
  as_tibble()%>%
  mutate(subject_id = as.character(subject_id))

# Read and convert patients data into a tibble
patients_tble <- read_csv("~/mimic/hosp/patients.csv.gz") %>%
  as_tibble()%>%
  mutate(subject_id = as.character(subject_id))

chartevents_final_tble <- chartevents_final_tble %>%
  mutate(subject_id = as.character(subject_id))


# Inner join icustays_tble with patients_tble
mimic_icu_cohort <- icustays_tble %>%
  inner_join(patients_tble, by = "subject_id") %>%
  mutate(age_intime = year(intime) - anchor_year + anchor_age) %>%
  filter(age_intime >= 18) %>%
  inner_join(admissions_tble, by = c("subject_id", "hadm_id")) %>%
  left_join(labevents_tble%>% group_by(subject_id), by = "subject_id") %>%
  left_join(chartevents_final_tble %>% group_by(subject_id), by = "subject_id")

# Print summary of mimic_icu_cohort
glimpse(mimic_icu_cohort)

```



## Q8. Exploratory data analysis (EDA)

Summarize the following information about the ICU stay cohort `mimic_icu_cohort` using appropriate numerics or graphs:

- Length of ICU stay `los` vs demographic variables (race, insurance, marital_status, gender, age at intime)


- Length of ICU stay `los` vs the last available lab measurements before ICU stay

- Length of ICU stay `los` vs the average vital measurements within the first hour of ICU stay

- Length of ICU stay `los` vs first ICU unit

**Answer:**
```{R}
model <- lm(los ~ race + insurance + marital_status + gender + age_intime, data = mimic_icu_cohort)
summary(model)
```

```{R}
# Fit a linear regression model
model2 <- lm(los ~ Bicarbonate + Chloride + Hematocrit + Potassium +Potassium + `White Blood Cells`, data = mimic_icu_cohort)

# Summarize the regression results
summary(model2)

```

```{R}
vars_to_convert <- c("heart_rate", "systolic_blood_pressure", "diastolic_blood_pressure", "body_temperature_Fahrenheit", "respiratory_rate")

for (var in vars_to_convert) {
  mimic_icu_cohort[[var]] <- as.numeric(mimic_icu_cohort[[var]])
}

mimic_icu_cohort$mean_vital_signs <- rowMeans(mimic_icu_cohort[, c("heart_rate", "systolic_blood_pressure", "diastolic_blood_pressure", "body_temperature_Fahrenheit", "respiratory_rate")])

model3 <- lm(los ~ mean_vital_signs, data = mimic_icu_cohort)

# Summarize the regression results
summary(model3)

```

```{R}

# Conduct ANOVA
anova_result <- aov(los ~ first_careunit, data = mimic_icu_cohort)

# Summary of ANOVA results
summary(anova_result)


```
